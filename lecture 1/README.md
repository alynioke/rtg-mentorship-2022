## How to use this resource

Welcome to your first homework! 

We recommend you to repeat what you see in lecture in video, to follow the teacher and code up all pieces on your own - the way you understood HTML/CSS! It's okay if it will be not 100% same as on lecture. 

While repeating try to understand what are you doing and while - if you don't find answers in lecture, google it or ask in #front-end-track chat in slack.

If something goes very wrong and you are stuck in repeating lecture material - you can see results in [classwork folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/classwork) here on Github. You can take a peek there. If issues appear when you're doing homework - you can check code in [homework folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/homework) and see code there.

If you have more questions/issues with code, or doing more complicated project, come to coding evening, and let's solve it together!

## Homework

### To explore

- Get familiarised with [guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- Try playing game [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) to understand more about how to build layouts with CSS
- Inspect [RTG mentorship webpage](http://www.rigatechgirls.com/mentorship2022) - find some elements you like, or styles. Then inspect with Chrome DevTools & try to apply some things to your own webpage. As example, you can see how images are made links in "Contact us" block at the very bottom.

### To code up

- Change background image of intro slide, its size (make it smaller) and opacity (make it a bit transparent, eg 85%)
- Change font family for the whole page (download any different google font you like). [How to install & use font.](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started)
- Add 2 more questions and answers in FAQ section, once you hover on those - make the text in question and answer underlined
- Show Video title ‘Watch the closing event of TechMentor 2021’ below the video without changing HTML
- Add sticky/fixed footer at the bottom of viewport with your initials who created this page (you could add background colour, links or anything you want here as well)
- Read what are lists and items in HTML. Apply “unordered list” in HTML to FAQ answer for "We have mentors representing 12 tracks:" - for each track name to be a list item.
- In quote section, put a link for "Susan Wojcicki" that will lead to her wikipedia article. Style the link to have bright pink color.
- After video section, add new section:
  - dark blue backgorund
  - white color of font
  - it should contain links of RTG facebook, instagram, youtube, linkedin
- When you press “LEARN MORE” button, scroll is very fast. Make a smooth scroll with CSS.
- Come up with idea of new page and code it up.
  - Page should have at least 2 big blocks + same footer as on main page (you can browse existing RTG website or mentorship website for inspiration).
  - New HTML page should have same font as old one.
  - It should have new CSS file attached to it (this way code will be clearer).
  - Create a link on main page that will open page #2.
  - Create a link on page #2 that will lead back to main page
