## How page looks like

## Homework for mentees

### To do:

- In quote section, put a link for "Susan Wojcicki" that will lead to her wikipedia article. Style the link to have bright pink color.
- Use RTG font for everything on the page. Instructions how to install & use it:
  --- https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started
  --- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono#standard-styles
- Read what are lists and items in HTML [must insert good link here?]. Apply unordered list in HTML to FAQ answer for "We have mentors representing 12 tracks:" - for each track name to be a list item.
- After quote section, instead new section:
  --- dark blue backgorund
  --- white color of font
  --- it should contain links of RTG facebook, instagram, youtube, linkedin
- [More advanced point? Not sure what]

### To train/read

- Try playing game flexbox frog https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to understand more about how to build layouts with CSS
- Inspect http://www.rigatechgirls.com/mentorship2022 - find some elements you like, or styles. Then inspect with Chrome DevTools & try to apply some things to your own webpage. As example, you can see how images are made links in "Contact us" block at the very bottom.

## Some points about code for lecturers

To everyone: Not using semantical html (e.g. section, ordered headings) because:

- wanna keep things easier, 'div' & 'span' are enough for lecutre #1
- gotta leave something for a11y lecture to improve on

To Laura: please show chrome dev tools! Very important.

To Laura: Box-model - margin/padding/size - must be explained.

To Laura: you gotta share background image in some easy way with mentees, consider using ej.uz

To everyone: THINGS WE WON'T USE AND DON'T NEED:

- BEM (use simple names for classes)
- media queries (won't cover at all in whole course)
- CSS shorthands. Please use full, e.g. instead of margin: 20px use margin-left: 20px, etc. for verbosity while learning
- flexbox should be used but don't spend time digging into logic (it will their be homework)
- position: relative/absolute
- styling via tag names or IDs in CSS. Instead, always use classes.
