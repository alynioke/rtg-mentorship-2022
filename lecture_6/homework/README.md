# React homework

Add chevron arrow next to each question and using state update it's position:
When the question is open, by checking the current state the appropriate className should be added on the elemnt to move the arrow down,
when it's closed a different className should be used to move the arrow side ways.

Also can improve the code to toggle the questions, so it would be possible to close them on clicking again on each question.
The final code is in this folder.
