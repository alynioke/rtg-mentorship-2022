The three pillars of modern world WEB Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If HTML adds structure and CSS adds flavour and style, then JavaScript brings the page to life.

Here are five whys of JavaScript:

## The five whys of JavaScript

### 1. Why JavaScript?

JavaScript was born out of necessity in year 1995 by NetScape developer. Initially called "Mocha". Fun fact: The initial version was created in just 10 days.

### 2. Why was JavaScript made by NetScape?

During Browser wars: NetScape vs Microsoft, NetScape were looking for an edge (pun not intended) over Microsoft in terms of served page and internet quality.

### 3. Why was JavaScript created?

To provide more value and support for served web pages. With JavaScript support from the NetScape, the browser was able to add interactive events to page improving readability and user experience that other browsers were not able to do at the time.

### 4. Why JavaScript got so popular to get adapted not only by Netscape but all common browsers?

JavaScript quickly gained popularity by being able to turn static pages in live interactive mediums for viewers, thus getting wildly adapted by all popular browsers and becoming house hold Web Development tool.

### 5. Why JavaScript keeps staying popular and one of top most used languages even today?

JavaScript is still undergoing rapid growth, and there are more supported features ever year. Allowing Developers to create complex and wonderful applications completely in your browser. No installation necessary, open URL and start editing document or spreadsheet, or stream a movie, or even play a game and chat with your friends.
To keep track of all changes versions are called EcmaScript. Currently most supported version is [EcmaScript 6](https://caniuse.com/?search=es6)

Fair warning - the learning curve is a steep, but rewarding.

ðŸ†˜ If something goes very wrong and you are stuck in repeating lecture material â€” you can see end result in [classwork folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/classwork). If issues appear when you're doing homework â€” you can check code in [homework folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/homework). I encourage you not to copy paste everything from there â€” after all, in real life, there will be no folder with solutions! So use results only when really stuck and googling didn't help. And as Laura said, "practice brings confidence" â€” so I hope that you will practice!
