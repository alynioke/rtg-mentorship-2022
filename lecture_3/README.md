# Instructions to create dynamic open/close FAQ section

ðŸ†˜ If something goes very wrong and you are stuck in repeating lecture material â€” you can see end result in [classwork folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/classwork). If issues appear when you're doing homework â€” you can check code in [homework folder](https://github.com/alynioke/rtg-mentorship-2022/tree/main/lecture%201/homework). I encourage you not to copy paste everything from there â€” after all, in real life, there will be no folder with solutions! So use results only when really stuck and googling didn't help. And as Laura said, "practice brings confidence" â€” so I hope that you will practice!
