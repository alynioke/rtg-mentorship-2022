# Pre-Homework

Before we go into details, there are few exercises that are worth going through. 
This will provide understanding of what is Git and why we need it, as well as basic Git operations.

1. *Check out this video* - Git Tutorial Part 1: What is Version Control? It explains in details why people use Version Control, Git (and GitHub), and what would happen without it. It’s a pretty cool intro into how programmers collaborate, when they work on the same project.

2. *Go through (and even better - complete) this tutorial* - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world. It helps you get a basic understanding of what is GitHub (which uses Git) and it provides great first insights into the world of sharing code. It’s very straight forward, but please read the text carefully and don’t be afraid to break things :sweat_smile:

3. *Set up Git on your computer*. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git There are instructions for all the operating systems: Linux-based, MacOS, Windows. You need only the **Setting up part**, nothing more.
