# Learning to work with GitHub and publish your webpage

This folder provides guidance on working with Git, GitHub and publishing your webpage.

Learning git and Github will help you to publish your website online to show the results of your work to your friends, family, and future employer! Moreover, when you will be doing homework for future job applications, employers always ask you to share your code via Github, so this skill is a must-have for a junior front-end developer.

# Pre-Homework

Before we go into details, there are few exercises that are worth going through. 
This will provide understanding of what is Git and why we need it, as well as basic Git operations.

1. *Check out this video* - [Git Tutorial Part 1: What is Version Control?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GKpbI1siow) It explains in details why people use Version Control, Git (and GitHub), and what would happen without it. It’s a pretty cool intro into how programmers collaborate, when they work on the same project.

2. *Go through (and even better - complete) this tutorial* - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world. It helps you get a basic understanding of what is GitHub (which uses Git) and it provides great first insights into the world of sharing code. It’s very straight forward, but please read the text carefully and don’t be afraid to break things :sweat_smile:

3. *Set up Git on your computer*. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git There are instructions for all the operating systems: Linux-based, MacOS, Windows. You need only the **Setting up part**, nothing more.

# Homework

To better learn this material please see the homework below.

We are going to create a simple, personal webpage, which is all about you!<br>
Share simple things about yourself, thoughts on life or picutres of pets :) 

> Beware that our website will be **public** and **available online!**

I advice to do most of the work via Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS/Linux)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your personal website
2. Clone this repository to your local computer
3. Create index.html and style.css, then go on and create your personal webpage<br>
   a page about you, than you can use to show your friends and family :P
4. Stage the files and commit the changes
5. Push them into repository
6. Enabled `Pages` to work with your GitHub repository
7. Share your creation and be proud of it!
